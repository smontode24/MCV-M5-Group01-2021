# Week 2

## T1:

All experiments can be found inside the Jupyter Notebook in the folder `notebook_modified`.

## T2 & T3: 

File `inference2_3.py` is developed as a list of experiments. If the requirements are met (are the same as Detectron2 Google Collab), you can run the file directly.
It will generate a list of CSV files for each experiment.

## T4:

All scripts for training, testing, and output preparation (for evaluator) can be found inside the folder `kitti_project`. Post-hoc analysis can be found in the folder `posthoc_analysis`.

## T5:

Overleaf page.
